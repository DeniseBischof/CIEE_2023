## Input

### Input only using Scripts:

You can create an Input System through scripting. We have to check in the Update method if a key is being pressed.

    public class KeyCodeExample : MonoBehaviour
    {
        void Update()
        {
            if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
            {
                Debug.Log("Space key was pressed.");
            }
            
            if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Space))
            {
                Debug.Log("Space key is being held.");
            }
    
            if (Input.GetKeyUp(KeyCode.Space))
            {
                Debug.Log("Space key was released.");
            }
        }
    }

You can find all the Keycodes you can  use in Unity here: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html


### Input using the Input Manager:

You can assign multiple keys for one specific input, as well as tweak some of the settings such as sensitivity.
Open the Input Manager under Edit>Project Settings>Input Manager. Set Fire1 to a button of your choice. 

![Input in Unity made easy (complete guide to the new system) - Game Dev  Beginner](https://gamedevbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/Input-Manager-Fire-1.png)
Use this Script to test if it works:

    public class ExampleInputManager : MonoBehaviour
    {
        public void Update()
        {
            if (Input.GetButtonDown("Fire1"))
            {
                Debug.Log("You pressed the Fire Button");
            }
        }
    }

*****Question:
How could you create local multiplayer using the same keyboard?*****

## Movement

### Movement using Translate and the Input System:

     private float horizontal;
     private float vertical;
     private Vector3 direction;
     
     public float speed = 5.0f;
     
     void Update(){
     	horizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
     	vertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
     	direction = new Vector3(horizontal, 0, vertical);
     	
    	 transform.Translate(direction * speed * Time.deltaTime);
     }

Can also be used for 2D games direction = new Vector3(horizontal, vertical, 0);

*****Questions:
How would you add jumping? (hint: [Rigidbody.AddForce](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddForce.html))
What could be a problem?*****



### Movement using Character Controller:
Add the Character Controller component to your object.
![](https://docs.unity3d.com/uploads/Main/Inspector-CharacterController.png)

Add the script:
	
	private CharacterController controller;
	private Vector3 playerVelocity;
	private bool groundedPlayer;
	private float playerSpeed = 2.0f;
	private float jumpHeight = 1.0f;
	private float gravityValue = -9.81f;

	private void Start()
	{
		controller = gameObject.GetComponent<CharacterController>();
	}

	void Update()
	{
		groundedPlayer = controller.isGrounded;
		if (groundedPlayer && playerVelocity.y < 0)
		{
			playerVelocity.y = 0f;
		}

		Vector3 move = new Vector3(Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"), 0, Input.GetAxis("Vertical"));
		controller.Move(move * Time.deltaTime * playerSpeed);

		if (move != Vector3.zero)
		{
			gameObject.transform.forward = move;
		}

		// Changes the height position of the player..
		if (Input.GetButtonDown("Jump") && groundedPlayer)
		{
			playerVelocity.y += Mathf.Sqrt(jumpHeight * -3.0f * gravityValue);
		}

		playerVelocity.y += gravityValue * Time.deltaTime;
		controller.Move(playerVelocity * Time.deltaTime);
	}
	
### Camera follow:

You can make the camera a child of your player, but for smoother movement use Lerp.

    	public Transform target;
    	private Vector3 target_Offset;
    	
     private void Start()
     {
    	 target_Offset = transform.position - target.position;
     }
     
     void Update()
     {
    		 transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, target.position+target_Offset, 1f);
     }

## Animator

In order to animate your character, you have to add an **Animator** component to your object.
In your project window right klick **Create>Animator Controller**. Drag and drop it into the **Animator** component.
![Unity学习笔记：Animator、Animator Controller、Animation Cilp之间的关系、以及Blend  Tree的用法；_刘欢明的博客-CSDN博客](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/538b9ad248044d65b1c98e8604658f0a.png)
Open **Window>Animation>Animator**.
![Unity Animator Controller Not Working](https://answers.unity.com/storage/temp/194328-screenshot-2022-03-22-223129.png)
Drag and drop your animations into the animator window. Right click on your idle animation and **Set as Layer Default State**.

In **Parameters** create a bool called walk. Right click on your idle animation and choose **Make Transition**. Click on the white arrow and under conditions choose walk and set it to true. Make a transition back to idle and set walk to false.
Turn off **Has Exit Time**.
![Unity Animation System Part 2. Objective: Add a Walking Animation to… | by  Bill Rislov | Medium](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*SYC7ovY0qlutaYylMji7JA.gif)
*Depending on which artstyle you chose, you have to change some of the transition settings.
Here are some explanations: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Transition.html*

In order to switch between animations, you have to call your animator component via script and change the value.

        Animator my_Animator;
        
        void Start()
        {
            //This gets the Animator, which should be attached to the GameObject you are intending to animate.
            my_Animator = gameObject.GetComponent<Animator>();
        }
	    void Update()
        {
            if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.UpArrow))
                my_Animator.SetBool("walk", true);
            else
                my_Animator.SetBool("walk", false);
        }

The better method for walking is to check if the current vertical/horizontal movement  is over 0.1f through using:
```
anim.SetFloat("walk", Input.GetAxis("Vertical"));
anim.SetFloat("walk", Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"));
```

## Collision/Trigger

The physics engine simulates collisions using colliders. We can determine how objects will behave under collisions. 

Add a Collider component to your gameobject. You will need to have a RigidBody component on one of the objects for the collision to be detected.

Simply add this to your script:

    void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
        {
	         Debug.Log(" You collided.");
        }
    void OnCollisionStay(Collision collision)
        {
	         Debug.Log(" You are colliding.");
        }
    void OnCollisionExit(Collision collision)
        {
	         Debug.Log(" You stopped colliding.");
        }

On the other hand, triggers are special setups of colliders. The purpose of triggers is to trigger events when multiple objects overlap. The objects won't collide anymore (they will simply pass through each other) if one of the Colliders is setup as a Trigger as it will use the event system.

![OnCollisionEnter vs. OnTriggerEnter and when to use them | by Jared Amlin |  Level Up Coding](https://miro.medium.com/max/660/1*8BNF0dH4znccz1YehR9p_g.png)

    private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {
        Debug.Log(" You entered the triggerarea.");
    }
        private void OnTriggerStay(Collider other)
    {
        Debug.Log(" You are in the triggerarea.");
    }    
    private void OnTriggerExit(Collider other)
    {
        Debug.Log(" You left the triggerarea.");
    }

If you only want to trigger an event when colling with a specific object, you can use Tags to identify them.

![Unity - Manual: Tags](https://docs.unity3d.com/uploads/Main/tag-dropdown.png)

    private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {
         if (otherGameObject.tag == "Enemy")
         {
    	      Debug.Log("Triggered by Enemy");
         }
    }
